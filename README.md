BuildBuddy is an open source Bazel build event viewer. It helps you collect, view, share and debug build events in a user-friendly web UI.

It's written in Golang and React and can be deployed as a Docker image. It's run as a [cloud hosted service](https://buildbuddy.io) and can be deployed to your cloud provider or run on-prem. BuildBuddy's core is open sourced in this repo under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tryflame/buildbuddy/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Features

* **Deep-dive into builds** - BuildBuddy captures build logs, invocation details, target information, and artifacts so you get a complete picture of your build.

* **Squash slow builds** - BuildBuddy's timing data allows you to identify and fix slow targets before they slow down your whole team.

* **Debug together** - Share BuildBuddy links with co-workers to get your problems solved quickly so you can get back to coding.
